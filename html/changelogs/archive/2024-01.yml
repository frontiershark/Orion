      a bottle of alifil, this little thing''ll fit in your pocket and give your characters
      guaranteed relief from sleepiness, stuttering and sickliness. Some side effects
      may occur. Consult your doctor before use. This new kit is available cheaply
      from cargo and from medical''s departmental orders, too.'

      symptom support kit. Spacers no longer start with a bottle of atrociously, unbelievably
      useless ondansetron patches.

      defense & frontier medkits, a ton of Kahraman frontier clothing, wheely-heels
      and in-hand empty gun cases! MODlink scryers are also now available as a pocket
      slot option too, so you can video-call your friends with a scarf.
  - bugfix: Holobadges are now accessible from both the neck and accessory loadout
      slots (since they fit in both).

  Hatterhat:

  - rscadd: Shields (and pillows) can be used to shove people around the same way
      barehanded right-clicking does. Xenos and borgs can actually be moved this way.
  - rscadd: Added a new MODsuit module, the bulwark module, which prevents knockdown
      and staggering from shoving, and getting pushed away by thrown objects. Inbuilt
      for the safeguard MODsuit, but one might also it in the black market.
  - refactor: Disarming has been refactored. You can now shove simple critters onto
      tables and into bins and closets

      stock market individually.
  Orion_the_Fox, Halcyon:
  - image: updated the Crop Top Turtleneck sprite, including adding a Teshari-compatible
      version!
  - balance: removed on-the-fly recoloring, BUT now the turtleneck can carry some
      basic items and warms you up a bit! ... as much as a croptop really can, I guess.
  Paxilmaniac:
  - rscadd: Four new implants have been added to either company imports in deforest
      medical, or in combat implants research for free from robotics.
  - image: Sprites for everything for the new implants done by me.

      Wear a scarf and a holobadge together!
  - bugfix: Custom say emotes now properly apply lowercase at the start where appropriate
      and also trim excess whitespace. Cleaner and easier for everyone!
  - bugfix: Anti-gravity harnesses now properly apply various interactions with the
      Spacer quirk.
  - bugfix: Players now receive a visible status effect alert when benefitting from
      the gravity wellness buff given by the Spacer quirk.
