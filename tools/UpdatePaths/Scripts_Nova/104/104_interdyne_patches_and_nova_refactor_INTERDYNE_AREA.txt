# DO NOT RUN 
# - UNLESS YOU ARE WORKING ON AN INTERDYNE PR THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO NOVA PR 104
# REMEMBER TO DISCARD THE CHANGES THIS WILL MAKE TO ALL TG CONTENT BEFORE PUSHING
# YOU WILL BREAK THOSE MAPS IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS
# This contains refactored area and spawner paths for Interdyne (lavaland and icemoon),
# and some comments for new child areas that didn't exist. Consider adding them!
#
# This is designed specifically as a favor for anyone with an Interdyne rework in progress
# that has thus far let it remain dependent on TG lavaland ruin area, it will spare you a 
# lot of pain.

# IF YOU DO NOT USE THESE, THEY *WILL* SPAWN WITH TG EQUIPMENT, NOT OLD SR MODULAR EQUIPMENT,
# SR MODULAR EDITS WERE REMOVED FROM THE ORIGINAL SPAWN POD WITH 104 TO REDUCE
